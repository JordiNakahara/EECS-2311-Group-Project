# EECS 2311 Group 9 Project - Standalone Java Fitness App

## Our revised list of big user stories is
1. Customizable exercise choices. - ability to change an exercise if you feel uncomfortable with it or just don't like it. 
2. Choose difficulty/area of workout. - The user wanted to be able to choose the area of the body to workout and the difficulty in the initial stages.
3. GIFS showing exercise for the duration of the workout. - Due to the difficulty of looping a video we decided to use GIFs instead
4. Streaks counter to keep people motivated. - Will have a streak counter to let you know how many consecutive days to exercised. 
5. Being able to extend rest times between workouts incase pace is too fast. - If rest times between exercises are too short, can be extended 3 times every workout.

## For this iteration we have decided to implement the following small user stories
1. Fixed altgifs
2. fixed difficulty settings
