#Day 2: Thurs Feb 9 Log
##Harrish's Commits
  - Created BMRCalc class and initialized the BMRCalc methods code. Assisted by Gaurav.
##Jordi's Commits
  - Created a stub database class
    - The class reads and writes user information to a text file
  

#Day 3: Fri Feb 10 Log
##Harrish's Commits
  - Created User class.
  - Updated User class to have initial coding requirements such as instance variables, a overloaded constructor, and getter/setter methods.
  - Updated User class to create a constructor method that takes no input parameters.
##Jordi's Commits
  - Added error handling to the database class
  - Added the ability to read individual user properties from the text file
  
 #Day 6: Mon Feb 13 Log
 ##Harrish's Commits
   - Updated BMRCalc class to have getter and setter methods.
   - Updated BMRCalc class to be named BMRCalculator so that the use case is more clear. Also removed setter method and set the main function to private.
   - Updated User class to adjust coding of the overloaded constructor class and how it creates the object.
   - Updated the User class overloaded constructor method to use regular constructor method to create User object first before using the parameters required to set values of the User object.
   - Updated BMRCalculator class method to run using a User object instead of just the parameters required for the mathematical function. Made the main function public again.

##Meeting summary
  - Remaining to do:
    - GUIs
    - Unit testing
    - Revise planning from iteration 0 (on a new document)
    - Wiki
    - Architecture sketch

##Harrish's Commits
   - Updated user class instance variable BMR to public so that it can be affected by BMRCalc method. Also changed code to use the classes setter and getter methods.

#Day 1: Mon Feb 27 log
##Meeting summary
   - Meet with Omnia again
   - GUI is not as important for this iteration
     - We should still spend some time working on the GUI
   - This iteration is database heavy
   - What we need for iteration 2:
     - Enter data
     - Store data
     - Pull up data at a later time
     - Data is user information
     - Implement a basic form of workouts
     - Possibly implement streaks
   - Mandatory attendance in Wednesday lecture hours.
   - Need to communicate better as a group
   - 

#Day 3: Wed Mar 1 log
##Meeting summary
   - After a meeting with a client we revised our big user stories
     1: Adding workout choices
     2: Select difficulty and duration
     3: Add GIF's for the workouts and maybe simpler version of workout
     4: Rest periods within the workout
     5: Suggested exercises based on categories not done
     6: Favourite exercises based on workout history
   - To-do for iteration 2:
     - Add workouts
     - Make real database with MySQL
       - Initialize database and table
       - Store user information to table
       - Update user information as needed
     - More unit tests
     - Tidy code and planning
     
   - Work distribution for iteration 2:
     - Jordi: Change stub database to real database, update User profile GUI to match needs, create database and necessary methods for exercises, and can help with junit if needed
     - Zeena: Workout timer method and junit tests
     - Harjot: Workout GUI
     - Gaurav: Workout class and workout GUI
     - Harish: Workout class, and workout start GUI
