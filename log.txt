#Day 2: Thurs Feb 9 Log
##Harrish's Commits
  - Created BMRCalc class and initialized the BMRCalc methods code. Assisted by Gaurav.
##Jordi's Commits
  - Created a stub database class
    - The class reads and writes user information to a text file
  

#Day 3: Fri Feb 10 Log
##Harrish's Commits
  - Created User class.
  - Updated User class to have initial coding requirements such as instance variables, a overloaded constructor, and getter/setter methods.
  - Updated User class to create a constructor method that takes no input parameters.
##Jordi's Commits
  - Added error handling to the database class
  - Added the ability to read individual user properties from the text file
  
 #Day 6: Mon Feb 13 Log
 ##Harrish's Commits
   - Updated BMRCalc class to have getter and setter methods.
   - Updated BMRCalc class to be named BMRCalculator so that the use case is more clear. Also removed setter method and set the main function to private.
   - Updated User class to adjust coding of the overloaded constructor class and how it creates the object.
   - Updated the User class overloaded constructor method to use regular constructor method to create User object first before using the parameters required to set values of the User object.
   - Updated BMRCalculator class method to run using a User object instead of just the parameters required for the mathematical function. Made the main function public again.
