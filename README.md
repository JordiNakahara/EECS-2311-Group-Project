# EECS 2311 Group 9 Project - Standalone Java Fitness App

This is the planning portion of our project. Here we will discuss what features we plan on including in our final product. 

We are planning on creating a standalone Java fitness app for the personal computer, where our focus is to streamline exercising to reduce the motivation lost when having to navigate a complex app just to get fit. The basics of the application is that it allows the user to pick a part of the body to workout, where then they will be provided a video showcasing the suggested workout routine. The app will also be able to track your progress.   

## We have had interviews with some potential users, and from deliberations, we have decided to implement these features into our app as well, ordered from most important to the least:
1. Customizable exercise choices. - ability to change an exercise if you feel uncomfortable with it or just don't like it. 
2. Choose difficulty/area of workout. - The user wanted to be able to choose the area of the body to workout and the difficulty in the initial stages.
3. Video showing exercise for the duration of the workout. - instead of an initial showcase, the video will be played for the duration. 
4. Streaks counter to keep people motivated. - Will have a streak counter to let you know how many consecutive days to exercised. 
5. Being able to extend rest times between workouts incase pace is too fast. - If rest times between exercises are too short, can be extended 3 times every workout.
6. Being able to save your favourite exercises.
7. Have goals suggested by the app to help keep you fit and on track.
